    "# Identifying Food Deserts in Roanoke VA \n",
    "### Hypothesis: do food deserts exist within Roanoke City?\n",

    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "##### In this project, I am to use clustering to find areas where there are few, or no, grocery stores in certain Roanoke-area neighborhoods. Ideally, I will find that no food deserts exist. This could prove interesting to local non-profits, such as the organization LEAP, which aims to help provide healthy food in low-income neighborhoods by linking local farmers to these communities; LEAP leverages grants and donations to help subsidize the cost of food for these neighborhoods. The findings could prove useful for the LEAP team in identifying new places for pop-up markets.\n",
