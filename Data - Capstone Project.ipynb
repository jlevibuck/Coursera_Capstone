    "#### Data:\n",
    "##### Using zip codes for Roanoke City, as well as neighborhood location information and Foursquare data for grocery stores, I will look at clusters that have few grocery stores or food options. Secondarily, I will identify neighborhoods with large clusters of convenience stores. Third, if the geographical data can be found, I would like to map transport information (i.e., bus stops) in these clusters. Last, if possible, I will make a comparison of average wages in areas that have few grocery stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### I intend to spot-check my findings using tools like Google Maps, as the city is relatively small and quick visual checks will show if my data pulls and work are correct."
